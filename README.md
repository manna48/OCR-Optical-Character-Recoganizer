# OCR-Optical-Character-Recoganizer

To extract readable datasets from an image or a scanned document. Given a set of
structured documents, build an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model, which will spew out
the field name, and corresponding field values that a user is interested in.

### Task:
One important aspect of any intelligent OCR solution is to efficiently extract the field names (keys)
and corresponding field values (values) from a set of structured documents (template). In this task,
you will be given different sets of documents that follow a particular structure. The task will be to
train the OCR model to detect the given field name and field values as accurately as possible.
Data Provided:
The data contains multiple purchase invoices from the retail industry having numerous key, value
